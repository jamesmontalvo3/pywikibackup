Py Wiki Backup
==============

Py Wiki Backup is a python script designed to allow backing up multiple
installations of MediaWiki with a single action.

As of 13-MAR-2014 it is still under heavy development.


Setup
-----

Copy the config.example.json file to config.json and replace values as
necessary. Sorry, I'll add more directions here at a later time.
